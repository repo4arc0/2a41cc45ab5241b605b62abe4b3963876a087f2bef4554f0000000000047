数百万年前
Millions of years ago...

28
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,850
一颗振金陨星
A meteorite made of vibranium...

29
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,970
那是全宇宙最强大的物质

30
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,180
落在了非洲大陆上

32
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,880
当人类时代到来

33
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,090
五个部落定居于此  并称之为瓦坎达

34
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,480
几个部落总在彼此争斗

35
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,730
直到一位萨满战士

36
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,980
通过黑豹女神芭丝特看到幻象

37
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,070
并在她的指引下找到心形草

38
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,230
那株植物赋予了他

39
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,590
超人的力量  速度和直觉

40
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,190

四个部落同意听从国王的统治

44
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,290
但贾巴里部落却自己隐于山中
But the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains.

45
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,180
瓦坎达人用振金发展了科技
The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology...

46
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,320

49
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,080
为了保护振金
To keep vibranium safe...

50
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,220
瓦坎达人决意隐藏起来
The Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight...

51
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,010
对外界世界隐瞒
Keeping the truth of their power

52
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,760
他们真实的力量
from the outside world.

53
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,310
我们还在隐藏吗  爸爸
And we still hide, Baba?

54

Coming up on them now.

145
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,200
不必  奥克耶  我自己来就好
No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone.

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,490
我会尽快救娜吉雅出来
I will get Nakia out as quickly as possible.

147
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,960
你看到她时可别僵住了
Just don't freeze when you see her.

148
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,750
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,140
我才不会僵住
I never freeze.

150
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,090
怎么回事
What's going on?

151
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,430
车熄火了  还打不着
It's the car. It lost power. It won't start.

车打不着
The car no start.

153

引擎熄火了

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,260

准备防御
Defense positions.

159
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,050
准备防御

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,310
准备防御
Defense positions!

164
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,150
别耍花招
No games.

165
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,470
你看到了什么
What do you see?

166
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,470
回复  回复
Come in. Come in.

167
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,640
那边  注意
Over there! Look back!

168
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,500
小心
Watch out!

169
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,380
特查拉  不要
T'Challa, no!

170
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,000
他还是个孩子
This one's just a boy.

171
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,900
他也是被绑架来的
He got kidnapped as well.

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,920
娜吉雅
Nakia...

173
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,880
我想...
I wanted...

174
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,170
我瞄着她呢  别动  不然我开枪了
I have her! Don't move! I will shoot!

175
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,210
我会打死她的
I will shoot her right now.

176
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,700
你僵住了
You froze.

177
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,240
你来干什么  你破坏了我的行动
Why are you here? You've ruined my mission.

178
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,980
我父亲死了  娜吉雅
My father is dead, Nakia.

179
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,500
我明天要加冕为王了

180
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,100
我希望你能到场

181
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,120
回家去吧
Carry yourselves home now.

182
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,710
带上那男孩  送他回族人那里
And take the boy. Get him to his people.

183
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,600
谢谢
Thank you.

184
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,940
你们绝不能提起今天的事
You will speak nothing of this day.

185
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,190
好
Yes.

186
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,350

187
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,130
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,920
娜吉雅姐妹
Sister Nakia...

189
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,560
王子陛下
My prince...

190
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,030
我们到家了
We are home.

191
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,380
怎么看都不腻
This never gets old.

192
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,490
太后陛下
Queen mother...

193
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,250
公主
Princess...

194
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,500
节哀顺变

195
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,940
谢谢  娜吉雅
Thank you, Nakia.

196
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,690
很高兴你又回到了我们身边
It is so good to have you back with us.

197
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,710
带她去河部落
Take her to the river province

198
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,180
为仪式做准备
to prepare her for the ceremony.

199
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,320
是  将军
Yes, general.

200
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,710
他僵住了吧
Did he freeze?

201
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,400
就像车前灯下的羚羊
Like an antelope in headlights.

202
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,800
闹够了没
Are you finished?

203
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,680
我妹妹居然会
So surprised my little sister came

204
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,890
在大日子前来看我
to see me off before our big day.

205
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,810
想得美
You wish!

206
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,880
我是为电磁脉冲珠来的  我做了升级
I'm here for the emp beads. I've developed an update.

207
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,250
升级  不  这个挺好使的
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

208
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,690
我还要教你多少次
How many times do I have to teach you?

209
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,090
就算好使
Just because something works

210
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,030
也总还有改进的空间
doesn't mean that it cannot be improved.

211
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,620
你教我  你知道什么啊
You are teaching me? What do you know?

212
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,200
比你知道得多
More than you.

213
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,260
我等不及看你怎么升级
I can't wait to see what kind of update you make

214
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,370
你的礼服了
to your ceremonial outfit.

215
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,020
苏睿
Shuri!

216
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,640
抱歉  妈妈
Sorry, mother!

217
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,630
你今天感觉怎么样  妈妈
How are you feeling today, mama?

218
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,910
骄傲
Proud.

219
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,390
你父亲和我经常谈论这一天
Your father and I would talk about this day all the time.

220
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,060
他与我们同在
He is with us...

221
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,720
你该成为国王了
And it is your time to be king.

222
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,890
早上好
Good morning.

223
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,130
我能帮你什么吗
How can I help you?

224
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,020
我就是来看看这些文物
I was just checking out these artifacts.

225
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,490
他们说你是位专家
They tell me you're the expert.

226
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,310
可以这么说
You could say that.

227
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,240
它们真美
They're beautiful.

228
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,020
这个是哪来的
Where's this one from?

229
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
波波阿尚蒂部落
The bobo ashanti tribe...

230
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,350
在如今的加纳
Present day Ghana...

231
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,530
是19世纪的
19th century.

232
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,420
真的吗
For real?

233
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,420
那这个呢
What about this one?

234
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,660
那个贝宁伊多人的文物
That one's from the Edo people of Benin...

235
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,340
16世纪的
16th century.

236
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,550
再跟我说说这个
Now, tell me about this one.

237
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,580
也是贝宁的  7世纪
Also from Benin, seventh century.

238
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,900
弗拉部落吧
Fula tribe, I believe.

239
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,760
不对
Nah.

240
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,050
什么
I beg your pardon?

241
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,050
是贝宁的英军劫走的
It was taken by British soldiers in Benin

242
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,390
但它原本来自瓦坎达
but it's from Wakanda.

243
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,370
而且是用振金制造的
And it's made out of vibranium.

244
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,840
别担心
Don't trip.

245
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,410
我会把它带走的
I'm gonna take it off your hands for you.

246
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,850
这些文物是不出售的
These items aren't for sale.

247
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,510
你以为你的祖先是怎么得到它们的
How do you think your ancestors got these?

248
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,080
你觉得他们是付了公道的价钱买下的吗
You think they paid a fair price?

249
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,570
还是他们夺走的  就像其他一切他们夺走的东西
Or did they take it, like they took everything else?

250
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,060
先生  我得请你离开了
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

251
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,790
这么多的保安
You got all this security in here

252
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,590
从我走进来就一直盯着我
watching me ever since I walked in.

253
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,440
但你却没注意
But you ain't checking for

254
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,850
自己喝下了什么东西
what you put in your body.

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,390
好了  哥们  走吧
All right, mate. Let's have it.

256
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,350
行了  你该走了
Come on, mate. Time.

257
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,680
她好像不太舒服
I think she might not be feeling too good.

258
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,070
救命啊  来人啊
Somebody get some help! Come here!

259
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,290
叫个医生  拜托  谁救救她
Call a doctor, please! Please, somebody, come help!

260
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,680
急需医疗救援
Medical emergency right away

261
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,900
前往西非展厅  速来
in the west African exhibit, please, right away.

262
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,670
小心
Look out.

263
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,490
请退后  谢谢
Step back, please. Step back. Thank you.

264
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,450
借过  医务人员  借过
Coming through over there. Medics coming through.

265
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,530
我去休息一下
I'm gonna take a break.

266
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
给她点空间  拜托
Let's give the lady some space, please.

267
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,510
退后  先生们
Step back, please, gents.

268
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,970
请退后
Step back, please.

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
过来
Hey, come here.

270
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,880
过来
Come here. Come here.

271
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,140
没事
It's okay.

272
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,450
你可以走  但别告诉任何人  好吗
You can go, but just don't tell anyone, all right?

273
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,420
哥们  你怎么不直接打死他
Bro, why you ain't just shoot him right here?

274
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,200
因为让犯罪现场分散开一点会更好
Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out.

275
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,970
让人以为我们很业余
Makes us look like amateurs.

276
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,760
好了
Now then,

277
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,100
看看你说得对不对吧
let's see if you know what you're talking about.

278
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,490
小试牛刀而已
That's just a taste.

279
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,610
-你要发财了  -你最好赶紧出手
- You're gonna be a rich boy. - You better sell that quick.

280
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,360
已经出手了
It's already sold!

281
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,750
不管你想做什么
Whatever you try,

282
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
瓦坎达人会找上门来的
the Wakandans will probably show up.

283
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,670
那最好不过了
That'll make my day.

284
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,020
我可以一石二鸟
I can kill two birds with one stone.

285
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,750
你不是说那也是振金吧
You're not telling me that's vibranium, too?

286
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,270
不  我就是挺喜欢
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

287
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,430
前进
Onward!

288
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,120
前进
Onward!

如果有哪个部落要举荐战士

想挑战王位

这件束身衣好不舒服
This corset is really uncomfortable...

311

365
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,050

恢复黑豹神力

374

并带你进入先祖之域

375
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
特查卡

376
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,210

来见你儿子吧

379
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,370
父亲

380
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,110
儿子

站起来

383

你是国王了

384
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,390
怎么了  儿子
What is wrong, my son?

385
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,970
我还没准备好
I am not ready.

386
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,680
你难道不是这辈子
Have you not prepared

387
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,700
都在为做国王做准备吗

388
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,850
难道你没有一直在我身边

我指的不是这个

391
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,220
我还没准备好与你分离

392
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,030
没有让孩子准备好
A man who has not prepared his children

393
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,550
面对他死亡的人

394
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,680
是个失败的父亲

395
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,830
我辜负过你吗
Have I ever failed you?

396
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,290

我想做个好国王  爸爸

399
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,450
就像您那样
Just like you.

400
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,920
你会面临困境
You're going to struggle.

401
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,380
所以你要让身边
So you'll need to surround yourself

402
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,890
有值得信赖的人
with people you trust.

403
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,870
你是个好人  有善良的心
You're a good man with a good heart.

404
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,310
好人是很难当好国王的

405
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,650
呼吸

406
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,290
特查拉  呼吸

00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,620
呼吸

408
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,780
我见到他了
He was there.

409
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,850
我见到他了  我父亲
He was there. My father.

410
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,050
就一个
Just one?

411
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,740
回家吧  娜吉雅
Come home, Nakia.

412
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,720
我不回来了吗
I'm right here.

413
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,760
留下吧
Stay.

414
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,910
我是来支持你

415
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,890
并缅怀你父亲的
and to honor your father...

416
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,080
但我不能留下
But I can't stay.

417
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,960
我在外面世界里找到了自己的使命
It's just, I found my calling out there.

418
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,770
我见到了太多贫困的人  不能再视而不见
I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.

419
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,770
我在这里开心不起来
I can't be happy here

420
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,640
因为我知道外面世界里还有一无所有的人
knowing that there's people out there who have nothing.

421
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,020
那你希望瓦坎达做点什么
What would you have Wakanda do about it?

422
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,760
分享我们的资源
Share what we have.

423
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,920
我们可以提供援助
We could provide aid

424
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,250
分享技术
and access to technology

425
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,870
庇护难民
and refuge to those who need it.

426
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,930
其他国家也这么做  我们能做得更好
Other countries do it, we could do it better.

427
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,670
我们跟其他国家不一样  娜吉雅
We are not like these other countries, Nakia.

428
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,760
如果世界得知了我们真正的样子
If the world found out what we truly are,

429
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,880
我们拥有什么
what we possess,

430
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,050
我们可能会失去现在的生活
we could lose our way of life.

431
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,290
瓦坎达有足够的力量帮助他人
Wakanda is strong enough to help others

432
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,240
并保护自己
and protect ourselves at the same time.

433
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,250
如果你不是这么固执  本可以当个好王后
If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.

434
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,980
正因为我固执  我才能当个好王后
I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn.

435
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,770
-承认了吧  -如果我想当王后的话
- See, you admit it! - If that's what I wanted.

436
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,740
那是它吗
Is that him?

437
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,670
芭丝特保佑  它还在长吗
Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing?

438
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,460
当然
Of course.

439
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,570
娜吉雅回来了
I see Nakia is back.

440
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,040
你们要再续前缘吗
You guys going to work it out?

441
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,870
特查拉
T'Challa...

442
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,600
怎么了
What's wrong?

443
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,120
娜吉雅觉得我们该多做一点
Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

444
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,140
怎么多做
More, like what?

445
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,590
援助他国  难民计划
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

446
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,320
你放难民进来
You let the refugees in...

447
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,860
他们只会带来他们的麻烦
They bring their problems with them.

448
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,420
到时瓦坎达就会像其他地方一样了
And then Wakanda is like everywhere else.

449
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,190
如果你要我和我的人
Now if you said you wanted me and my men,

450
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,090
去清扫外面的世界
to go out there and clean up the world,

451
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,410
那我愿意
then I'll be all for it.

452
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,940
但我们从不会
But waging war on other countries

453
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,690
向他国宣战
has never been our way.

454
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,480
你也收到了
You, too, huh?

455
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
芭丝特保佑  我们有麻烦了
Bast! We're in trouble.

456
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,430
国王陛下
My king.

457
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,710
亲爱的
My love.

458
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,160
你们绝对猜不到我们刚发现了谁
You will never guess who just popped up on our radar.

459
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,700
一件未能被认出的瓦坎达文物
A misidentified Wakandan artifact

460
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,530
昨日被从大不列颠博物馆盗走

我们得知  尤利西斯·克劳

462
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,200
打算于明晚在韩国将振金

463
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,290
出售给美国买家
in South Korea tomorrow night.

464
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,540
克劳已经潜逃近30年了
Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years.

465
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,100
未能逮捕他  或许是我父亲最大的遗憾
Not capturing him is, perhaps, my father's greatest regret.

466
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,220
我想把克劳抓回来接受审判
I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial.

467
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,270
瓦坎达现在需要的不是一名战士
Wakanda does not need a warrior right now.

468
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,670
我们需要一名国王
We need a king.

469
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,230
我父母在他的袭击中丧生
My parents were killed when he attacked.

470
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,350
我每一天都深深铭记着
Not a day goes by when I do not think about

471
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,060
克劳让我们失去了什么
what Klaue took from us.

472
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,870
让我失去了什么
From me.

473
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,850
这个机会太好  不容错过
It's too great an opportunity to pass.

我需要你留下保护边境

那我请求你

478
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,840
要么将他就地正法

479
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,110
要么把他带回来
or you bring him back to us.

480
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,540
我保证
You have my word.

481
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,170
我会带他回来的
I will bring him back.

482

我们将执行这项任务

483
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,290
国王陛下
My king!

484
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,240
别闹了
Stop it. Stop it.

485

490
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,870
是的
Yes.

491
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,070
我们不会有事的
We'll be fine.

492
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,290
再说  如果需要支援  我们还能联系你

502
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,210
真正的问题是  你穿的是啥玩意

503

你怎么在我的实验室里露脚指头

如果你要去对付克劳

517
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,690
你会需要设计部能拿出的最好作品

533
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,940
别那么用力啊  天才

我请你来我的实验室
I invite you to my lab,

536

你就乱踢乱打吗

罗斯特工
Agent Ross.

582
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,240
陛下
Your highness.

583
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,990
你是克劳的买家
You are buying from Klaue.

584
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,190
不管我做什么
What I'm doing or not doing,

585
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,860
都是代表美国政府
on behalf of the U.S. government

586
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,280
而且与你无关
is none of your concern.

587
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,930
不管你是想干什么
Now, whatever the hell you're up to,

588
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,670
帮帮忙  别来妨碍我
do me a favor, stay out of my way.

589
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,670
我把泽莫交给了你
I gave you Zemo.

590
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,020
而我不是替你保守了秘密
Didn't I keep it under wraps,

591
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,820
没让人知道一位第三世界国家的国王
that the king of a third world country

592
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,940
穿着一身防弹猫咪战衣满街跑吗
runs around in a bulletproof cat suit?

593
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,360
我觉得我们扯平了
I'd say we were even.

594
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,360
你真得马上走了
You really need to leave, now.

595
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,060
克劳要跟我走
Klaue is leaving out that door with me.

596
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,630
我警告你了
You've been warned.

597
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,000
三  双骰
Three, craps.

598
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,360
你赢了
You won!

599
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,310
知道吗
You know what?

600
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,640
这个我就
I think I'll just take these,

601
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,350
暂时拿来
bring them over here

602
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,910
替他保管一下好了
and hold on for safekeeping.

603
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,630
注意  瓦坎达国王来了
Okay, heads up. The king of Wakanda is here.

604
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,750
不能让他带走克劳
He cannot leave with Klaue.

605
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,190
好吧
All right.

606
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,030
索科威亚袭击事件中的振金
Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia

607
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,070
被查到了一个
links back to a person

608
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,370
我没说我要来这儿
that I'm not actually saying

609
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,680
跟他交易的人头上
I'm here to make a deal with,

610
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,940
但这次交易不能取消
but that deal will not be called off.

611
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,220
等事情告一段落
When the dust settles,

612
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,880
我们可以谈个交易
you and me can work something out.

613
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,670
我不是来交易的
I'm not here to make a deal.

614
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,010
克劳  带了八个人
Klaue, plus eight!

615
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,100
将军
General.

616
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,420
已就位  可以守住出口
In position to secure our exit.

617
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,380
振金呢
And the vibranium?

618
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,900
我还没看到
I don't see it yet.

619
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,120
这里不是不许带武器吗
I thought there were no weapons allowed in here.

620
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,800
按理说是的
There's not supposed to be.

621
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,920
有人可不知道呢
Somebody did not get the memo.

622
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,610
绝对有武器
Definitely armed.

623
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,650
好有架势的随从
Well, that is quite the entourage.

624
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,870
你是要发新专了吗
You got a mix-tape coming out?

625
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,700
是啊  还真有
Oh, yeah. Yeah, actually, there is one.

626
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,880
如果你喜欢  我可以把链接发你
I'll send you the soundcloud link, if you like.

627
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,290
戴夫  你能把音乐链接发给他吗
Hey, Dave, can you get the link to the tape?

628
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,060
拜托  别逼我听你的曲子
Please, don't make me listen to your music.

629
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,980
我就是说  你带了好多人来
I just meant you got a lot of people with you.

630
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,750
你以为他们是为你准备的吗
You think they're for you?

631
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,570
别担心
Don't worry.

632
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,830
我可以自己跟你完成交易
I can do a deal with you all by myself,

633
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,080
多谢了
thank you very much.

634
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,840
又来了六个  这是陷阱
Six more. It's a setup.

635
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,400
你拿钻石来了吗
You got the diamonds?

636
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,790
来吧  别捏了
Okay. That's enough.

637
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,480
-我们得去拿下克劳  -别妄动
- We need to move on Klaue. - Stand down.

638
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,450
不能引起枪战
We can't afford a shootout.

639
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,250
振金呢
Vibranium?

640
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,120
我本想买个高档的公文箱
I was going to buy a fancy suitcase.

641
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,560
但还是决定省省钱
But I thought I'd save myself some money.

642
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,630
再不动手就没机会了
It's now or never.

643
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,720
别妄动
Stand down!

644
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,720
我被发现了
I've been made.

645
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,860
瓦坎达人  他们来了
Wakandans! They're here!

646
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,280
-快走  -杀光他们
- Get outta here! - Kill 'em all!

647
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,460
快去拿钻石
Diamonds, quick!

648
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,480
杀人犯
Murderer!

649
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,910
知道吗
You know,

650
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,930
你跟你老子真像
you look just like your old man.

651
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,080
我撒钱雨了
I made it rain!

652
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,650
我们走吧  老大
Let's get out of here, boss!

653
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,760
太爽了  太爽了
That was awesome! That was awesome!

654
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,030
走吧  开车  快走
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

655
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,340
-我们丢下他吗  -他会追上来的
- Do we just leave him? - He'll catch up.

656
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,720
苏睿
Shuri!

657
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,520
太好了
Yes!

658
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,400
遥控驾驶系统已启动
Remote driving system activated.

659
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,160
等等  这是左驾还是右驾
Wait! Which side of the road is it?

660
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,020
看在芭丝特的分上
For Bast's sake!

661
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,140
-开吧  -好啦  冷静点
- Just drive! - Okay, calm down!

662
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,650
走咯
Let's go!

663
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,900
放点音乐  你当这是送葬啊
Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral?

664
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,050
哪辆是他
Which one is he in now?

665
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,180
分头走
Hey, split up!

666
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,370
-他们想甩掉我们  -我走右边
- They're trying to lose us. - I'll take the right.

667
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,730
我们追另两个  我看到条近路
We'll take the other two! I see a shortcut.

668
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,370
我们过不去的
We're not going to make it!

669
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,590
继续开
Keep going!

670
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,130
老哥
Brother!

671
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,630
那是什么
Hey, what was that?

672
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,770
别想了  你棒棒哒
Don't worry about it. You're doing great.

673
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,470
枪
Guns.

674
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,080
真原始
So primitive!

675
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,200
那是振金车  白痴
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

676
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,780
子弹打不透的
The bullets won't penetrate!

677
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,760
你干什么
What are you doing?

678
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,970
开你的车
Just drive.

679
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,320
该死
Shit!

680
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,950
看你的战衣
Look at your suit.

681
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,410
你挨了好多子弹
You've been taking bullets,

682
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,470
战衣积蓄了不少动能
charging it up with kinetic energy.

683
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,600
绕到卡车另一边
Pull around the truck.

684
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,450
他哪去了
Where'd he go?

685
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,240
臭显摆
You show-off.

686
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,660
他在那里
There he is!

687
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,850
把住
Hold tight!

688
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,060
好  我们玩玩吧
All right. Let's have some fun!

689
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,960
上车
Hop in.

690
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,710
把矛放后备箱里吧
Put that spear in the trunk.

691
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,500
再快点  苏睿
Faster, Shuri.

692
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,430
我已经开到最快了
I'm going as fast as I can!

693
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,210
右转  右转
Take a right! Take a right!

694
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,270
不不
No, no, no!

695
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,470
老哥
Brother!

696
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,050
克劳
Klaue!

697
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,590
你以为我们会忘记吗
Did you think we would forget?

698
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,490
看着我  杀人犯
Look at me, murderer!

699
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,380
这武器你从哪弄来的
Where did you get this weapon?

700
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,480
你们这些蛮子不配拥有它
You savages didn't deserve it.

701
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,090
饶命啊  陛下  饶命
Oh, mercy, king. Mercy.

702
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,490
你喘的每一口气都是我仁慈的体现
Every breath you take is mercy from me.

703
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,620
陛下
King!

704
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,870
世界在看着呢
The world watches.

705
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,350
几位  我们快走吧
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

706
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,500
嗯
Yeah.

707
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,720
有人吗
Hello.

708
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,720
我看得到你们  真的
I can see you! I can. I can see you.

709
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,780
真是闹得好大
So this is a big mess, huh?

710
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,360
我们不如唱红脸白脸
I figured we could go good cop, bad cop.

711
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,540
我先进去跟他谈  然后你们去
I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in.

712
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,000
我们不能让他单独跟克劳谈
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

713
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,370
最好让他单独跟克劳谈5分钟
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes

714
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,070
别在这里闹不愉快
than to make a scene here.

715
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,830
等你审问过他
After your questioning,

716
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,840
我们要带他回瓦坎达
we will take him back to Wakanda with us.

717
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,640
什么  不行
What? No.

718
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,590
我很喜欢你
Look, I like you, a lot.

719
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,560
但他已经被我缉拿  他哪里都不去
But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere.

720
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,350
听着  我光是允许你们来
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor

721
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,980
就是给你们面子了
by letting you even be in here.

722
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,040
他再敢碰你一次
If he touches you again,

723
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,230
我就把他插在那个桌子上
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

724
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,240
她会说英语吗
Does she speak english?

725
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,120
她想说就说
When she wants to.

726
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,060
我进去了
I'm going in.

727
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,580
等我问完了  你们再上
When I'm done, you guys are up.

728
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,370
-罗斯特工  -怎么
- Agent Ross. - Yeah?

729
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,940
我很感谢你在釜山的帮助
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

730
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,410
瞧见没
You see that?

731
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,510
这叫外交
It's called diplomacy.

732
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,700
不客气
You're welcome.

733
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,130
奥克耶
Okoye.

734
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,140
客气点
Play nice.

735
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,510
美国人啊
Americans.

736
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,980
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

737
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,770
爱是什么
What is love?

738
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,070
宝贝  别再伤害我
Baby, don't hurt me

739
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,290
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

740
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,460
你不该相信那些瓦坎达人
You know, you really shouldn't trust the Wakandans.

741
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,960
我跟你才是一类人
I'm much more your speed.

742
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,000
我干这行  谁都不信任
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

743
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,880
但我对外面那门手臂炮感兴趣
But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there.

744
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,660
那是哪来的
Where'd you get that?

745
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,820
就是被我调试过的旧采矿工具
It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to.

746
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,190
但如果你要  我可以给你弄一个
But I can get you one, if you like.

747
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,990
你何不说出你供货商的名字
Why don't you give me the name of your supplier,

748
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,440
我直接去找他们要
and I'll ask them.

749
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,810
他就在外面
He's right outside.

750
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,940
你自己去问他好了
Why don't you ask him yourself?

751
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,100
什么  特查拉吗
What? T'Challa?

752
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,970
你是说你手臂上的武器是瓦坎达来的
You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?

753
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,230
对了
Bingo.

754
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,500
你对瓦坎达究竟有什么了解
What do you actually know about Wakanda?

755
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,220
牧羊  纺织  衣服很酷
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

756
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,790
那都是幌子
It's all a front.

757
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,410
探索者找了那里几个世纪
Explorers searched for it for centuries.

758
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,480
传说中的黄金城
El dorado, the golden city.

759
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,710
他们以为是在南美洲
They thought they could find it in South America,

760
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,870
但其实一直都在非洲
but it was in Africa the whole time.

761
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,090
一个科技奇迹
A technological marvel.

762
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,720
就因为这个国家脚下
All because it was built

763
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,790
就是世上最珍贵的金属
on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man.

764
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,010
他们称之为"天赐"
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

765
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,540
就是振金
Vibranium.

766
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,930
振金  嗯  地球上最坚硬的金属
Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth.

767
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,300
不仅仅是金属
It's not just a metal.

768
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,480
他们把它缝进衣服里
They sew it into their clothes.

769
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,400
用它为城市供能  开发科技
It powers their city, their tech,

770
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,470
制造武器
their weapons.

771
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,030
武器
Weapons?

772
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,050
是的
Yeah.

773
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,960
我的手臂炮相比之下就像吹叶机
Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.

774
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,160
这真是个美丽的童话
That's a nice fairy tale,

775
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,220
但瓦坎达是个第三世界国家
but Wakanda is a third world country,

776
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,620
而且你把他们的振金都偷走了
and you stole all their vibranium.

777
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,340
我偷...
I stole...

778
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,720
我都偷走了
All of it?

779
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,130
我拿的不过九牛一毛
I took a tiny piece of it.

780
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,780
他们还有整整一山的
They have a mountain full of it.

781
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,100
他们已经开采了数千年
They've been mining it for thousands of years...

782
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,380
却还只是触及了矿藏的表层
And they still haven't scratched the surface.

783
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,700
我是唯一见到了真相
I'm the only outsider who's seen it

784
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,310
还活着出来的外人
and got out of there alive.

785
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,760
如果你不信
If you don't believe me,

786
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,590
你去问问你的朋友  他的战衣是什么做的
you ask your friend what his suit is made of.

787
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:24,020
他的爪子是什么做的
What his claws are made of.

788
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,780
你父亲对联合国说
Your father told the UN

789
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,880
克劳盗走了你们全部的振金
that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had.

790
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,760
但现在他却说你们还有
But now he's telling me you have more.

791
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,390
你相信一个
And you believe the word

792
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,110
捆在椅子上的军火贩的话吗
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

793
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,790
这是哪里
Where is that?

794
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,200
后面
Back there.

795
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,880
你们还藏了多少
How much more are you hiding?

796
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,680
外面有情况
Something is happening out back.

797
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,070
趴下
Get down!

798
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,590
别动
Stand down!

799
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:54,580
找掩护
Cover!

800
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,100
手雷
Grenade!

801
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,450
你们还真是不紧不慢啊
I see you took your time, didn't you?

802
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,760
陛下
My king!

803
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,990
陛下
My king.

804
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,480
娜吉雅
Nakia.

805
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
他替我挡了子弹
He just jumped in front of me.

806
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,670
他在这里是撑不下去的
I don't think he'll make it here.

807
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,840
子弹击中了脊椎
It hit his spine.

808
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,400
给我一颗灵珠
Give me a kimoyo bead.

809
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,850
这能暂时稳定他的情况
This will stabilize him for now.

810
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:58,880
把他交给我们
Give him to us.

811
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,370
我们可以救他
We can save him.

812
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,940
我们的任务是抓克劳回去
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

813
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,190
我们失败了
We failed.

814
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,060
此人还是外国情报人员
This man is a foreign intelligence operative.

815
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,390
我们要如何解释带他进入国境内
How do we justify bringing him into our borders?

816
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,180
他替我挡了子弹
He took a bullet for me.

817
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,020
那是他的选择
That was his choice.

818
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,350
那我们就要任由他死去吗
So now we are just supposed to let him die?

819
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,600
想想看  如果我们治好了他
Let us consider that we heal him.

820
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,380
他有责任向他的国家汇报情况
It is his duty to report back to his country.

821
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,150
作为国王  你则有责任保护我们国家
And as king, it is your duty to protect ours.

822
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,740
我很清楚我的职责  将军
I'm well aware of my duties, general.

823
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,490
我不能任他死去
I cannot just let him die,

824
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:45,030
而我们明明能救他
knowing we can save him.

825
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,990
我们究竟要带他去哪
Where exactly are we taking him?

826
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,820
好啊  又带来个受伤的白人让我们治
Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix.

827
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,440
这会很好玩的
This is going to be fun.

828
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,980
他不会有事的
He will live.

829
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,490
瓦卡比来了
W'Kabi is here.

830
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,190
怎么回事  兄弟  克劳呢
What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?

831
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,950
他不在
He's not here.

832
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,300
他从我们掌心里溜走了
He slipped through our hands.

833
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,920
"溜走了"
"Slipped"?

834
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,650
你父亲掌权30年  什么都没做
For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing.

835
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,950
我以为你会有所不同
With you, I thought it'd be different.

836
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:47,880
但看来还是那样
But it's more of the same.

837
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,130
我们走吧  老大
Let's get going, boss.

838
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,030
你总卖给中情局吗
You always sell to the CIA?

839
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,800
我卖给出价最高者
I sell to the highest bidder.

840
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,640
别担心  等我回了约翰内斯堡
But don't you worry. When I get back to Joburg,

841
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,050
避过了这阵风头
and I lay low for a bit,

842
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,870
我会让你俩拿到工钱的
I'll make sure both you guys get paid.

843
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,360
我才不担心钱的事呢
I ain't worried about the money, bro.

844
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,490
我知道你拿得出
I know you good for it.

845
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,300
我们回去的路上  把我们丢在瓦坎达就好
On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.

846
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,550
你可不想去那里  小子
You don't want to go there, boy.

847
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,550
我想去
Yeah, I do.

848
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,450
放下
Drop it!

849
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,860
否则你们雌雄大盗的组合  就今天解散
Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today.

850
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,980
马上放下枪
Put your gun down now!

851
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,320
对不起
I'm sorry.

852
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,550
-对不起  埃里克  -没事的
- Sorry, Erik. - It's gonna be okay.

853
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,630
你真想去瓦坎达
You really want to go to Wakanda?

854
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,250
他们都是蛮子
They're savages.

855
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:19,510
他们就这么对我们这样的人
This is what they do to people like us.

856
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,970
我可不怕烙印
I ain't worried about no brand.

857
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,010
看这个
Check these out.

858
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,190
每个都代表我杀的一个人
Each one is for a kill.

859
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,370
你怎么伤害自己无所谓
You can scar yourself as much as you'd like.

860
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,300
在他们看来  你始终是个外人
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

861
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,050
你要是以为自己能走进去就是疯了
You're crazy to think that you can walk in there.

862
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,310
我还当你是个疯子美国人呢
To think I saw you as some crazy American.

863
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,880
下去
Leave us!

864
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,640
你的任务未能如愿
So your mission did not go as planned.

865
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:18,360
我叔叔尼乔布究竟发生了什么
What happened to my uncle N'Jobu?

866
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,860
我父亲说他失踪了
My father told me he disappeared.

867
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,410
今天有个男人
There was a man today,

868
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,010
戴了跟这枚一样的戒指
wearing a ring identical to this one.

869
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,990
那不可能
That is not possible.

870
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,010
他帮助了克劳逃脱  而且他戴了这枚戒指
He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring!

871
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,950
我爷爷的戒指
My grandfather's ring!

872
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,990
别告诉我什么可能不可能
Do not tell me what is possible.

873
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,220
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth!

874
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:48,220
有些真相
Some truths...

875
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,590
太过沉重  特查拉
Are too much to bear, T'Challa.

876
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,210
那不由你来决定
That is not your choice to make.

877
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,320
他究竟怎么了
What happened to him?

878
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,690
我向国王保证过不会说的
I promised the king to say nothing.

879
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,470
现在我是你的国王了
I'am your king now!

880
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,900
你叔叔接受了
Your uncle took...

881
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,740
去美国做战士的任务
A war dog assignment in America.

882
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,780
你父亲
Your father...

883
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:33,980
把我安插在了那里
Placed me there...

884
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,690
观察他
To observe...

885
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,580
而他并不知情
Unbeknownst to him.

886
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,940
你叔叔爱上了个美国女人
Your uncle fell in love with an American woman.

887
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,020
他们生了个孩子
They had a child.

888
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,880
他在那里看到的困苦
The hardships he saw there...

889
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,150
让他变得激进
Radicalized your uncle.

890
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,550
我袖手旁观了很久
I observed for as long as I could.

891
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,310
他们的领袖遭人暗杀
Their leaders have been assassinated.

892
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,110
他们的社区被毒品和武器淹没
Communities flooded with drugs and weapons.

893
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:01,880
他们遭受警察暴力  执法过度
They are overly policed and incarcerated.

894
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,740
在世界各地
All over the planet

895
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,030
我们的同胞饱受苦难
our people suffer because

896
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,590
就因为他们没有反抗的能力
they don't have the tools to fight back.

897
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,450
如果有了振金武器
With vibranium weapons,

898
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,120
他们可以推翻每一个国家
they could overthrow every country,

899
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,960
瓦坎达可以一统天下
and Wakanda could rule them all

900
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,390
好好治理
the right way.

901
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,330
他知道你父亲绝不会答应
He knew your father would not support this.

902
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:22,150
所以  你叔叔背叛了我们
So, your uncle betrayed us.

903
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,320
不
No!

904
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,820
他帮助克劳盗取了振金
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

905
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,370
不不
No, no, no.

906
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,880
你要马上回国
You will return home at once...

907
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,590
并面见议会
Where you will face the council...

908
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,290
向他们坦白你的罪行
And inform them of your crimes.

909
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,850
他举起枪对准了我
He drew his weapon on me.

910
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,560
不
No!

911
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:59,260
你父亲杀了亲弟弟
Your father killed his own brother...

912
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:03,790
好救我
to save my life.

913
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:10,920
决不许说出去
Speak nothing of this.

914
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,540
那孩子呢
And the child?

915
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,830
我们丢下了他
We left him.

916
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,530
我们必须
We had to...

917
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,020
维系
maintain...

918
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,620
那个谎言
the lie.

919
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,430
这是什么
What is this?

920
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,520
一份薄礼
Just a little gift.

921
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,590
你是谁
Who are you?

922
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,190
好吧  我在哪
All right, where am l?

923
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,390
别那么吓我  殖民者
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

924
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,590
什么  我叫埃弗雷特
What? My name is Everett.

925
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,750
我知道  埃弗雷特·罗斯
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

926
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,650
前空军飞行员  现中情局特工
Former air force pilot and now CIA.

927
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,110
没错
Right.

928
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,580
好吧  这是瓦坎达吗
Okay, is this Wakanda?

929
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,260
不  是堪萨斯
No, it's Kansas.

930
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,170
韩国是多久之前了
How long ago was Korea?

931
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,390
昨天
Yesterday.

932
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,480
不可能
I don't think so.

933
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,140
枪伤不会魔法般的一夜恢复
Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.

934
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,370
在这里可以
They do here.

935
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,180
但不是靠魔法  是靠科技
But not by magic, by technology.

936
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,290
什么都别碰  我哥哥很快就会回来
Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.

937
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,330
这些火车
These train things...

938
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,110
是磁悬浮的吧
That's magnetic levitation, right?

939
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,270
当然了
Obviously.

940
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,820
当然了  但我从没见过这么高效的
Obviously, but I've never seen it this efficient.

941
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,740
那个灯板  是干什么的
The light panels, what are they?

942
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,260
-声波稳定器  -什么
- Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what?

943
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,490
未加工的振金太过危险
In its raw form vibranium is too dangerous

944
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,200
不能高速运输
to be transported at that speed,

945
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,710
所以我发明了一种办法让它暂时失效
so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.

946
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,420
那些火车上是振金
There's vibranium on those trains?

947
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,800
我们周围到处是振金
There's vibranium all around us.

948
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,770
我就是靠这个治好了你
That's how I healed you.

949
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,640
特查拉呢
Where is T'Challa?

950
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,860
他的灵珠被关闭了
His kimoyo beads have been switched off.

951
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,280
我们又不是连体婴  奥克耶
Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.

952
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,520
有个男人出现在了边境
A man showed up at the border

953
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,240
自称是杀了克劳
who claims to have killed Klaue.

954
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,950
什么
What?

955
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,630
瓦卡比此刻正在送他去王宫
W'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak, to the palace.

956
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,830
我们得找到你哥哥
We need to find your brother!

957
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,030
一个外人吗
An outsider?

958
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,500
不  是瓦坎达人
No, a Wakandan.

959
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,190
他不是瓦坎达人
He's not a Wakandan.

960
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,040
他是我们的人
He's one of ours.

961
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,930
他杀了亲弟弟
He killed his own brother...

962
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,390
还丢下了一个孩子
And left a child behind...

963
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:52,810
让他一无所有
with nothing.

964
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,450
什么样的国王
What kind of king...

965
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,580
什么样的人会做出这种事
What kind of man does that?

966
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,890
人无完人
No man is perfect.

967
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,140
你父亲也是
Not even your father.

968
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:08,130
他都没好好安葬他
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

969
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,990
我叔叔尼乔布背叛了我们  但我父亲
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father...

970
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,220
他可能制造了更可怕的东西
He may have created something even worse.

971
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:20,940
看着我
Look at me.

972
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,810
你不能让你父亲的错误决定你的为人
You can't let your father's mistakes define who you are.

973
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,460
你才能决定你要做怎样的国王
You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be.

974
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,930
哥哥  你得马上回来
Brother, you need to get here now!

975
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,590
埃里克·斯蒂文斯
Erik Stevens.

976
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:47,400
19岁从安纳波利斯毕业
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

977
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,300
在麻省理工学院攻读硕士

978
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,720
之后加入海豹突击队  去了阿富汗
Joined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan,

979
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,450
在那里杀人无数
where he wrapped up confirmed kills,

980
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,000
好像在打电游
like it was a video game.

981
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,870
开始有了杀人魔头的称号
Started calling him killmonger.

982
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:58,370
他加入了一个联合特种作战司令部的秘密部队
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.

983
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,920
他们可不是闹着玩的
Now these guys are serious.

984
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,120
他们会隐藏起来
They will drop off the grid,

985
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:02,410
进行刺杀
so they can commit assassinations

986
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,050
颠覆政府
and take down governments.

987
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,650
他有透露过他的身份吗
Did he reveal anything about his identity?

988
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,300
他有战士文身
He has a war dog tattoo,

989
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,630
但我们并无他的记录
but we have no record of him.

990
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,770
这人到底是不是瓦坎达人
Is this man Wakandan or not?

991
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,740
告诉我们究竟怎么回事
Tell us what is going on.

992
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,060
说吧
Speak.

993
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:46,450
说吧
Speak.

994
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,180
我来到了你的领地
I'm standing in your house,

995
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,070
处决了一个
serving justice to a man

996
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:54,610
盗走你们的振金  还杀了你们子民的罪人
who stole your vibranium and murdered your people.

997
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,300
这是你们国王没能做到的
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

998
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:04,880
我不管你是不是带来了克劳
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

999
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,440
我之所以没有就地杀了你
Only reason I don't kill you where you stand

1000
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,570
是因为我知道你的身份
is because I know who you are.

1001
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:12,530
你想怎么样
Now, what do you want?

1002
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,150
我想要王位
I want the throne.

1003
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:19,010
天呐
My goodness.

1004
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,660
你们都安安稳稳地坐在这里
Y'all sittin' up here comfortable.

1005
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,040
感觉很不错吧
Must feel good.

1006
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,320
全世界还有
It's about two billion people

1007
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,470
20亿跟我们一样黑皮肤的人
all over the world that looks like us.

1008
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,760
但他们的生活要艰辛得多
But their lives are a lot harder.

1009
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,340
瓦坎达有解放他们所有人的工具
Wakanda has the tools to liberate 'em all.

1010
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,910
什么工具呢
And what tools are those?

1011

振金  你们的武器

1013
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,540
我们不会去评判外人的行为
It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner

1014
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,860
并实施惩戒
for people who are not our own.

1015
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:51,380
外人
Not your own?

1016
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,120
但生命不是在这个大陆上诞生的吗
But didn't life start right here on this continent?

1017
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,760
那么所有人不都该是你的同胞吗
So ain't all people your people?

1018
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,730
我不是所有人的国王  我是瓦坎达的国王
Iam not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda.

1019
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,480
我的职责就是

1021
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,050
并确保振金

1022
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,030
不会落入你这种人手中

1024
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:12,510
我们已听够了这骗子的话
We have entertained this charlatan for too long.

1025
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,990
拒绝他的要求
Reject his request.

1026
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,900
我还没提出要求呢
I ain't requesting nothing.

1027

1030
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,190
那就是你的身份
That's who you are.

1031
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,830
那不是我的名字  公主
That's not my name, Princess.

1032
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,380
问我吧  国王
Ask me, king.

1033
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,380
不
No.

1035

带他走
Take him away.

1036
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,150
你是谁
Who are you?

01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:44,040
我叫尼贾达卡  尼乔布王子的儿子

我看到我爸爸尸体上有豹爪印
I found my daddy with panther claws in his chest!

1040
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,270
你才不是国王的儿子  你是杀人犯的儿子
You ain't the son of a king. You a son of a murderer.

1041
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:51,540
你撒谎
You're lying!

1042
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,830
-撒谎  -恐怕不是  太后陛下

别这么做  特查拉

作为尼乔布王子的儿子

1051
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,030
他有权利这么做

1052

我不需要全国都来  只要他来就行
The whole country ain't gotta be there. I just need him.

还要来个人给我解开镣铐

1057
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,280
特查拉  你知道此事吗

1058

他打不过特查拉的

1149
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:06,000
并带你进入先祖之域
and take you to the ancestral plane.

1150
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,640
不是叫你别乱翻我的东西吗
What did I tell you about going into my things?

1151
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,290
你找到了什么
What did you find?

1152
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,290
你的家乡
Your home.

1153
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,120
我给了你钥匙  就是希望你有一日能见到那里
I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.

1154
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:03,560
对
Yes.

1155
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,690
那里有世上最美的日落
The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world.

1156
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,640
但恐怕你还是不会受欢迎
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

1157
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:14,900
为什么
Why?

1158
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:19,040
他们会说你迷失了
They will say you are lost.

1159
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,710
但我就在这里
But I'm right here.

1160
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,550
不为我流泪吗
No tears for me?

1161
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,350
人人都会死
Everybody dies.

1162
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:37,200
这里的生活就是如此
It's just life around here.

1163
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,280
看看我做了什么
Well, look at what I have done.

1164
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,330
我早该带你回去的
I should've taken you back long ago.

1165
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:52,850
结果  我们都被抛弃在了这里
Instead, we are both abandoned here.

1166
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,500
或许你的家乡才迷失了
Well, maybe your home is the one that's lost.

1167
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,400
所以他们才找不到我们
That's why they can't find us.

1168
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:14,620
呼吸  呼吸  国王陛下  呼吸
Breathe! Breathe, my king, breathe.

1169
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,610
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1170
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,680
那是心形草的效力
The heart-shaped herb did that?

1171
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,300
这是全部的了吗
This all of it?

1172
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,850
对  这样等再有下任国王时
Yes. So when it comes time for another king,

1173
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:43,000
我们会有所准备
we will be ready.

1174
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:44,960
下任国王
Another king?

1175
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,790
全烧了吧
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

1176
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:50,950
陛下  我们不能那么做
My king, we cannot do that.

1177
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,370
这是我们的传统
It is our tradition...

1178
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:59,130
我叫你做什么的话  我就不是闹着玩的
When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit.

1179
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,690
全烧了
Burn it all!

1180
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,670
在我们那里
You know, where I'm from...

1181
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,440
黑人掀起革命时
when black folks started revolutions,

1182
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,400
从来没有足够火力
they never had the firepower,

1183
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,070
和资源去对抗压迫者
or the resources to fight their oppressors.

1184
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:03,700
那时候瓦坎达在哪
Where was Wakanda?

1185
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,840
到此为止了
Yeah, all that ends today.

1186
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:15,360
我们在全球每个国家都有探子
We got spies embedded in every nation on earth.

1187
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:16,670
都已就位
Already in place.

1188
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,860
我知道殖民者怎么思考
I know how colonizers think.

1189
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,210
我们就用他们的策略对付他们
So we're gonna use their own strategy against 'em.

1190
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:25,160
我们要把振金武器送去给我们的战士
We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs.

1191
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,070
让他们把武器分给全世界的被压迫者
They'll arm oppressed people all over the world...

1192
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,960
让他们能起义  杀死当权者
so they can finally rise up and kill those in power.

1193
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,120
还有他们的孩子
And their children.

1194
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,250
和其他与他们同流的人
And anyone else who takes their side.

1195
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:36,860
该让他们知道我们真实的样子了
It's time they know the truth about us!

1196
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:38,410
我们是战士
We're warriors!

1197
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:42,240
世界要大翻盘  这次  我们要占上风
The world's gonna start over, and this time, we're on top.

1198
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,800
瓦坎达将成为日不落帝国
The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.

1199
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:50,510
瓦坎达能延续至今
Wakanda has survived for so long,

1200
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,230
一直是只在绝对必要时动武
by fighting when only absolutely necessary.

1201
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:57,150
瓦坎达过去的确是如此行事
Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes.

1202
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,490
但世界在改变  将军
But the world is changing, general.

1203
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:04,230
长老们  世界越来越小了
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1204
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,380
外面的世界在追赶上来
The outside world is catching up.

1205
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:08,940
很快  局面就会成为不去征服
And soon it will be the conquerors

1206
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,010
便会被征服
or the conquered.

1207
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,500
我宁可做前者
I'd rather be the former.

1208
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:19,350
你们都听到命令了  我们开始吧
You heard your orders. Let's get to it.

1209
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:22,540
我们要去哪
So where are we going again?

1210
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:25,440
我们要带心形草去贾巴里部落
We're taking the heart-shaped herb to Jabaril and.

1211
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,300
心形草  那是什么
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

1212
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,840
服用者能获得增强的能力
It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.

1213
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,430
所以特查拉才那么强壮
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1214
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,090
娜吉雅
Nakia.

1215
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:39,660
这样不好
I don't like this.

1216
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,690
心形草是我们的
The herb belongs to us.

1217
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:45,670
给姆巴库  可能会造就更大的怪物
We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1218
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,520
娜吉雅  你该自己服下它
Nakia, you should take it yourself.

1219
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,580
我是个探子  还没有军队
I am a spy with no army.

1220
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,420
我绝无机会的
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1221
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:05,230
我们去吧
We'll go.

1222
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:13,400
天呐
Oh, boy.

1223
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,340
该死
Oh, shit.

1224
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,090
低头  保持冷静
Look down. Stay calm.

1225
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,330
苏睿
Shuri.

1226
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,590
低头
Look down.

1227
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:03,770
我儿子
My son...

1228
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:08,800
在仪式格斗中被杀
was murdered in ritual combat.

1229
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,810
-机会公平吗  -是的  但是
- Were the odds fair? - Yes, but...

1230
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:13,050
那就不是"被杀"  而是"被击败"
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

1231
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,340
-别戳我们的痛处  -闭嘴
- Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence!

1232
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:18,620
在这里  我才有权说话  小丫头
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

1233
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:23,170
殿下  新王是个美国...
Look, uh, your highness, the new king is a U.S...

1234
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,600
新王
The new king...

1235
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,440
你不能说话
You cannot talk!

1236
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,990
再多说一句
One more word,

1237
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:39,420
我就拿你喂我的孩子
and I will feed you to my children.

1238
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:46,010
我开玩笑的  我们吃素的
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1239
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,120
大猩猩姆巴库
Great gorilla M'Baku...

1240
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:02,250
我们是为此而来
This is why we are here.

1241
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,040
我们要把它献给你
To offer this to you.

1242
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:08,050
一个外人坐在了王位上
An outsider sits on our throne.

1243
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,410
只有你能帮我们阻止他
Only you can help us stop him.

1244
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,110
跟我来
Come with me.

1245
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,580
不可能
Impossible!

1246
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:54,370
他还有气吗
Is he breathing?

1247
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:57,210
他陷入了昏迷  生命垂危
He's in a coma. Barely clinging to life.

1248
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,390
我们的一个渔人发现了他
One of our fishermen found him

1249
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,060
漂到了河边
at the edge of the river border.

1250
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,680
他把他带来给了我
He brought him to me.

1251
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,190
你怎么把他放在雪里
Why do you have him in the snow?

1252
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,490
这是唯一让他不会
It is the only thing keeping him

1253
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,170
去见祖先的东西
from joining the ancestors.

1254
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:09,570
我们得送他去我的实验室  我在那里能治好他
We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there.

1255
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:11,720
带他走吧  他不出几秒就会死
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

1256
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,910
娜吉雅  心形草
Nakia, the herb.

1257
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:33,770
我呼唤祖先
I call upon the ancestors.

1258
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,830
我呼唤芭丝特
I call upon bast.

1259
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,440
我跟我儿子  特查拉在一起
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1260
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,710
治好他
Heal him.

1261
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:56,780
我们得把他埋起来  盖住他
We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him!

1262
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,560
好
Okay.

1263
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,730
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1264
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,220
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1265
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,780
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1266
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,150
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1267
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,700
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1268
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,740
醒醒  特查拉
Wake up, T'Challa.

1269
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,960
醒来吧
Wake up.

1270
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:26,410
儿子
My son.

1271
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:35,950
你该回家来
The time has come for you to come home...

1272
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,330
跟我团聚了
And be reunited with me.

1273
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,730
为什么
Why?

1274
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,840
你为什么不带那男孩回家
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

1275
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,430
为什么  爸爸
Why, Baba?

1276
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,200
他
He...

1277
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:06,510
他是我选择无视的真相
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1278
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,460
你不该抛弃他
You were wrong to abandon him.

1279
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,720
我选择了我的人民
I chose my people.

1280
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,420
我选择了瓦坎达
I chose Wakanda.

1281
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,150
我们的未来需要...
Our future depended...

1282
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:19,430
你错了
You were wrong!

1283
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,840
你们都错了
All of you were wrong!

1284
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,850
对外面的世界袖手旁观
To turn your backs on the rest of the world!

1285
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,500
我们因为害怕被发现
We let the fear of our discovery

1286
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,820
而没有做正确的事
stop us from doing what is right!

1287
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,120
再不能了
No more!

1288
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:43,120
我不能留下陪你
I cannot stay here with you.

1289
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:49,110
我不能安心地让他坐在王位上
I cannot rest while he sits on the throne.

1290
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:52,850
他是我们制造出来的怪物
He is a monster of our own making.

1291
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:57,670
我必须夺回王位  必须
I must take the mantle back. I must!

1292
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:02,080
我必须纠正错误
I must right these wrongs.

1293
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,670
你们有毯子吗
Do you have a blanket?

1294
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,830
杀人魔头有军队的完全支持
Killmonger has the full support of our military.

1295
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:21,850
而且
And

1296
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,550
他还烧掉了心形草园
he burned the garden of the heart-shaped herb.

1297
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:27,270
当然了
Of course he did.

1298
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:28,620
那是他受的训练
That's what he was trained to do.

1299
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,820
他的部队以前曾跟中情局合作
His unit used to work with the CIA

1300
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:33,030
颠覆外国政权
to destabilize foreign countries.

1301
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:35,260
他们总在权力交接时出手
They would always strike at transitions of power...

1302
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,540
比如大选之年  或是国王死后
Like an election year, or the death of a monarch.

1303
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,160
控制政府  军队
You get control of government, the military...

1304
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,000
-我们的资源  -没错
- Our resources. - Right.

1305
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,390
圣山
The great mound.

1306
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:46,540
我们的振金  我的科技
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1307
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,820
他会把我们的武器送去全世界
He will send our weapons all over the world.

1308
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:54,610
你必须带她们安全离开瓦坎达
You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

1309
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:56,200
-什么  -那你呢
- What? - What about you?

1310
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,630
挑战还要继续
The challenge will have to continue.

1311
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:02,380
特查拉  我们不会离开瓦坎达
T'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.

1312
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,430
我有责任保护你们
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1313
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,120
如果他拿到了我们的科技
If he gets control of our technology,

1314
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,990
哪里都不会安全了
nowhere will be safe.

1315
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,800
黑豹不死
The black panther lives.

1316
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,080
等到他为瓦坎达的命运而战时
And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda

1317
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,400
我也会伴他左右
I will be right there beside him.

1318
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:38,950
我也是
As will I.

1319
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:40,630
我也加入
I'm in, too.

1320
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,640
怎么了  你会需要全部的帮助
What? You're gonna need all the help you can get.

1321
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,090
你们煽情够了没
Are you done?

1322
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,540
够了没
Are you done?

1323
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:57,060
可以让我和姆巴库大人单独谈谈吗
Could you give me and lord M'Baku a moment?

1324
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:06,780
谢谢
Thank you.

1325
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,500
我欠你个大人情
I owed you a great debt.

1326
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,230
一命换一命
A life for a life.

1327
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,060
我们两清了
Consider it paid.

1328
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,900
请允许我母亲留下
Please allow my mother to stay here.

1329
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,140
她不会有事的  我保证
No harm will come to her. I give you my word.

1330
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:24,260
我还挺需要支军队的
You know, I could use an army as well.

1331
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:25,870
当然了
I bet you could.

1332
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,350
但不行
But no.

1333
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,920
我不能让贾巴里人为你的使命送死
I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause.

1334
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,370
这是我们的使命
It is our cause.

1335
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,270
-这是为了我们所有人  -我们吗
- It is for all of us. - Oh, us'?

1336
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,080
你是几世纪来第一个屈尊到此的国王
Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries,

1337
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,270
还说什么"我们"
and now you speak of "Us"?

1338
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,710
我无法代表先王们
I cannot speak for past kings.

1339
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:51,420
但此刻  有敌人坐在王位上
But an enemy sits on the throne right now.

1340
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:54,110
我们都清楚振金的威力
We both know the power of vibranium.

1341
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,310
如果杀人魔头拿到了它
If Killmonger gains control of it,

1342
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,380
你觉得他会来找谁
who do you think he will come for next?

1343
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:07,890
我们不会
We will not

1344
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,490
帮你的
help you.

1345
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,490
一切就绪
Everything is on schedule.

1346
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:41,690
探子都已得到消息了吗
Have the spies been alerted?

1347
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:44,280
是的  有些人抗拒我们的新任务
Yes. Some resistance to our new mission.

1348
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,700
但伦敦  纽约
But the war dogs in London,

1349
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,750
和香港的战士都就绪了
New York and Hong Kong are standing by.

1350
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,620
我们先攻击那里
We'll strike there first.

1351
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,510
其他人会想通的
The others will come around.

1352
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,150
看啊
Look at this.

1353
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,550
手持声波炮
A handheld Sonic Cannon,

1354
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,220
足以抵挡一辆坦克
powerful enough to stop a tank...

1355
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:59,220
金属探测器又探测不到
Untraceable by metal detectors.

1356
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:01,120
而我们有数千支
And we got thousands of them.

1357
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,060
世界会清楚地了解我们的本事
The world's gonna find out exactly who we are.

1358
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,970
他没死
He lives.

1359
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:45,100
尼贾达卡
N'jadaka!

1360
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:47,150
你好啊
Wassup?

1361
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,560
我还没认输呢
I never yielded!

1362
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:53,910
你看到了  我也没死
And as you can see, I am not dead!

1363
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,540
挑战已经结束了
All that challenge shit is over with!

1364
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,870
我现在是国王了
I'm the king now!

1365
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:00,480
让飞机升空  继续任务
Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission!

1366
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:10,480
-苏睿  行动  -收到
- Shuri, now. - Copy that.

1367
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:16,490
走  快走  走啊  罗斯
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

1368
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,190
瓦卡比  杀了这小丑
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1369
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:23,340
瓦卡比  挑战还没结束
W'Kabi, the challenge is not complete.

1370
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,710
我们怎么办
What will we do?

1371
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,310
边境部落
Border tribe!

1372
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:45,930
你
You!

1373
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:48,600
你的心里满是仇恨
Your heart is so full of hatred...

1374
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,720
你不配做国王
You are not fit to be a king!

1375
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,340
-来啊  -阿由  去帮国王
- Come on! - Ayo, the king!

1376
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,050
盾
Shields!

1377
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,360
瓦卡比  停下吧
W'Kabi, stop this!

1378
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,670
马上停下
Stop this now!

1379
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,110
不
No!

1380
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,320
娜吉雅和我会靠这个控制王爪飞船
Nakia and I will get control of the royal Talon with this.

1381
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,370
那我做什么
So what do I do?

1382
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,180
你得驾驶它
You'll have to fly it.

1383
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:34,860
-什么  -你曾是优秀的飞行员
- What? - You were a great pilot.

1384
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:36,990
别担心  我会教你的
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.

1385
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,270
就像开飞行摩托一样
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1386
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,500
什么  你们还有飞行摩托吗
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1387
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:43,560
娜吉雅  拿那个
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1388
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:46,550
-我不是护卫队的  -穿上吧  那是盔甲
- I'm not a dora. - Just put it on, it's armor!

1389
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,710
快来
Come!

1390
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,520
祝你好运  罗斯特工
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1391
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,440
我不知道该怎么办
Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing with this.

1392
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,660
我们指望你了
We're counting on you.

1393
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:09,840
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever.

1394
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,100
来啊
Come on!

1395
01:46:29,290 --> 01:46:30,180

1396
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:38,910
遥控驾驶系统已启动
Remote piloting system activated.

1397
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:41,210
天呐
My god.

1398
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,950
我为你弄成美国式的了  上去吧
I made it American style for you. Get in.

1399
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:45,570
好
All right.

1400
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:53,260
太好了
Yes!

1401
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:58,470
快走  别让武器离开瓦坎达境内
Go! We can't let those weapons get beyond Wakanda.

1402
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,170
好  我去了
All right, I'm on it.

1403
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,280
锁住
Lock!

1404
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,340
压住他
Get him down!

1405
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,290
拿项链
Get the necklace!

1406
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,400
拿项链
Get the necklace!

1407
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,780
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

1408
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:44,800
苏睿  我看到他们了  怎么做
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em. What do I do?

1409
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,500
击落啊  大天才
Shoot them down, genius!

1410
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,490
好吧
All right.

1411
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,730
放手一搏吧
Here goes nothing.

1412
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,550
击落了
All right, got them.

1413
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,830
该死
Oh, shit.

1414
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:06,510
该死
Shit, shit, shit.

1415
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:27,650
好啊
Nice!

1416
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,120
苏睿
Shuri!

1417
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,130
好啊  公主
What's up, Princess?

1418
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,880
你永远不会成为真正的国王
You'll never be a true king.

1419
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:16,270
哥哥
Brother!

1420
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:49,190
苏睿
Shuri.

1421
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:51,090
哥哥
Brother!

1422
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:53,750
打开底层的火车
Turn on the train on the bottom track.

1423
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,130
稳定器会让你的战衣失效的
The stabilizers will deactivate your suit!

1424
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,500
你就没有保护了
You won't have protection!

1425
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,710
他也一样
Neither will he.

1426
01:49:59,090 --> 01:49:59,820
好
Okay!

1427
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:26,370
我不需要战衣也能杀了你
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1428
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,090
你的统治结束了
Your reign is over!

1429
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:30,000
你坐在这里  安全无忧
You sat up here, safe and protected.

1430
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,290
你希望我们成为

1431
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:33,510
你如此仇视的那些人
just like the people you hate so much.

1432
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:35,250
像他们那样逐个击破这个世界
Divide and conquer the land as they did!

1433
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,040
不  我是学习了我的敌人

在他们的游戏里打败他们

1435

你已经变成了他们

1436
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:41,980
你会毁灭这个世界  包括瓦坎达

世界夺走了我的一切

1438

我爱的一切

1439
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:47,210
但我会跟世界扯平的
But I'm gonna make sure we're even.

1440
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:48,380
我会找到每一个
I'm gonna track down anyone who would

1441
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:50,280
想要忠于你的人
even think about being loyal to you!

1442
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,650
然后把他们埋进黄土之下
And I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt

1443
01:50:51,650 --> 01:50:52,990
跟祖厉做邻居
right next to Zuri!

1444
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,790

苏睿  我甩掉了一个  但后面还追着俩
Shuri, I've lost one of them, but two are on my tail.

1448
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:16,400
该死  怎么回事

1449

实验室遭受了袭击
The lab is under attack.

1450

取消全息图
Deactivating hologram.

1452
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,250
罗斯  你得快跑

1453
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:29,490

玻璃完整性为50%

1456
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,600
罗斯  罗斯
Ross! Ross!

1457
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:57,420
投降吧
Surrender now!

1458
01:51:58,050 --> 01:52:00,750
给你们三秒放下武器
You have three seconds to lay down your weapon!

1459
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:01,880
一

玻璃完整性为15%

苏睿  最后一辆货运飞船

1478
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,000
你会杀了我吗  亲爱的

1479
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,650
为了瓦坎达
For Wakanda?

1480

毫无疑问
Without question!

1481
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,660
你完蛋了  堂哥
This is it for you, cousin.

1482
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:57,540
好厉害的一招
Hell of a move!

1483
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,040

He promised he was gonna show it to me one day.

1486
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:31,200
你相信吗
You believe that?

1487
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,390
一个奥克兰孩子  却相信一个童话
Kid from Oakland, running around believing in fairy tales.

1488
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:25,290
好美啊
It's beautiful.

1489
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,330
或许我们还能治好你
Maybe we can still heal you.

1490
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:45,950
为什么
Why?

1491
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:49,660
好让你把我关起来吗
So you can just lock me up?

1492
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,320
不
Nah.

1493
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:58,310
把我葬在海里
Just bury me in the ocean...

1494
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:01,300
陪伴那些为自由而跳船的先祖
With my ancestors that jumped from the ships.

1495
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:05,640
因为他们知道  为奴不如赴死
'Cause they knew death was better than bondage.

1496
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:31,170
谢谢你
Thank you.

1497
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:34,340
你救了我

1498
01:59:35,610 --> 01:59:37,130
你救了我的家人
You saved my family.

1499
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:40,960
我们的国家
Our nation.

1500
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:43,300
不用谢我
There's nothing to thank me for.

1501
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,530
我们的责任就是...
It is our duty to...

1502
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,520
我的责任就是为我所爱而战
It was my duty to fight for what I love.

1503
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:54,030
我本该...
I should've...

1504
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:03,130
你不能怪我  我差点就死了
You can't blame me, I almost died.

1505
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:07,610
留下吧
Stay.

1506
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:13,450
我知道还有个办法能让你实现使命

1507
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:15,940
求你留下吧
Please stay.

1508
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:51,380
他突破了  突破了
Oh, he moves it! He moves it!

1509
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,930
-那人是谁  -篮下
- Who man is that? - Bucket!

轻松
Easy.

1511
02:00:57,350 --> 02:01:00,480
你说要第一次带我来加州的时候
When you said you would take me to California for the first time...

1512
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,400
我以为你是指去柯契拉音乐节
I thought you meant Coachella...

1513
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,160
或是迪士尼乐园

1514
02:01:05,070 --> 02:01:05,950
为什么来这里
Why here?

1515
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:12,580
这是我们父亲杀了叔叔的地方
This is where our father killed our uncle.

1516
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,610
他们要拆楼

1517
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:22,010
很好
Good.

1518
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,000
他们不会拆楼的
They are not tearing it down.

1519
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:27,080
我买下了这栋楼

还有那边那栋

1525

你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

1526
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:04,410
那是什么玩意
Man, what the hell is that?

1527
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:06,280
像是布加迪宇宙飞船
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1528
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:08,580
兄弟  它凭空就冒出来了  你们看见没
Bro, it came out of nowhere. Did y'all see that?

1529
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:12,870

我们可以坐这个回家

搭它去学校

我可不建议你们那么做

1537
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,220
-你从哪来  -瓦坎达
- Where you come from? - From Wakanda.

1538
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:28,630
瓦坎达是什么

那是你的吗
This yours?

02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:35,620
你...
Who...

1541

你是谁
Who are you?

1542
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:25,610
我是特查拉国王

将与外界共享我们的

知识和资源

1548
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:44,580
瓦坎达将不再只从隐蔽处窥探
Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows.

1549

1550
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:48,590
也不能再如此
We must not.

我们会尽力成为榜样

1552
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:54,570
让世人看到  地球上的人和国家

1553
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,140
应亲如兄弟姐妹

现在  甚于以往

分裂的幻觉威胁着我们的存在

我们的共同点多于不同之处

你们又跟他玩了吗
Are you playing around with that man again?

1567
